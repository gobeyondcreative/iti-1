                                <p>In light of the recent event surround the Coronavirus outbreak, congress signed the CARES act 
                                to help citizens with the undue financial burden caused by the mandated shutdowns. The CARES Act included the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) in order to provide financial assistance to those students who suffered disruption of their educational delivery due to the mandates.</p>
